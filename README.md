***What it does
The idea of capturing and preserving the unique texting behaviours of our loved ones inspired us to develop Echo - AI Companion. It’s a tool designed to mimic how they talk, ensuring you can always feel their presence, 
even from afar. Whether it’s a comforting text, playful banter, or heartfelt advice, Echo keeps the essence of those you care about alive in the form of a personalized AI chat experience.

***How we built it
Data Upload and Processing: Users upload their WhatsApp chat history in a structured format. We preprocess the data to ensure only relevant conversations are used while maintaining privacy. Model Fine-Tuning: 
We leverage Cohere’s natural language processing capabilities to fine-tune the chat model based on the unique patterns, tone, and style found in the chat data. Frontend Development: A user-friendly web interface 
was developed using React to allow users to upload their data and interact with the chatbot seamlessly. Backend Integration: The backend, built with Python and Flask, handles chat preprocessing, 
API calls to Cohere’s model, and chatbot responses.
