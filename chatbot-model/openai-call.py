    Please process the following file contents as described:

    Input:
    {file_content}

    Instructions:
    1. This is a conversation between {user} (the user) and {chatbot} (the chatbot). User talks first. 
    2. Determine where each conversation begins and ends. Save the conversations in the format:
    {{
        "messages": [
            {{
                "role": "System",
                "content": "You are a chatbot trained to answer the user's questions."
            }},
            {{
                "role": "User",
                "content": "Hello"
            }},
            {{
                "role": "Chatbot",
                "content": "Greetings! How can I help you?"
            }},
            {{
                "role": "User",
                "content": "What makes a good running route?"
            }},
            {{
                "role": "Chatbot",
                "content": "A sidewalk-lined road is ideal so that youâ€™re up and off the road away from vehicular traffic."
            }}
        ]
    }}

    3. Associate the content with the correct role (user or chatbot) as labeled in the .txt file.
    4. For each new conversation, create a new JSON object and append it to the output file.

    Output: Only the processed JSONL file, and I need at least 2 conversatoins to be returned, I need full conversations returned.
    Each conversation should have follow the same format as the example given. I need the file as a JSONL file, each line to be an individual JSON object
